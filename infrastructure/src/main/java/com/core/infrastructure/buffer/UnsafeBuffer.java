 * Supports regular, byte ordered, and atomic (memory ordered) access to an underlying buffer. The buffer can be a
 * byte[], one of the various {@link ByteBuffer} implementations, or an off Java heap memory address.
 *
 * <p>{@link ByteOrder} of a wrapped buffer is not applied to the {@link org.agrona.concurrent.UnsafeBuffer}.
 * {@link org.agrona.concurrent.UnsafeBuffer}s are effectively stateless and can be used concurrently, with the
 * exception of wrapping. To control {@link ByteOrder} use the appropriate method with the {@link ByteOrder} overload.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> This class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals.
 * Types may be different but equal on buffer contents.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The wrap methods on this class are not thread safe. Concurrent access should only happen after a
 * successful wrap.
